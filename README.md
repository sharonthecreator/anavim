# Anavim Guide
The best neovim configuration in the world, mostly used in the legendary mador -Â **Element**.
Here is a nice cheatsheet of all the special shortcuts you'll need to know when using it.

**Warning**: this guide is more users which are already comfortable with their Vim skills, if not - you are welcome to do the regular Vim builtin guide.

**Warning2**: install me in ~/.config/nvim (**git clone git@gitlab.org:neovim/anavim.git ~/.config/nvim**)
